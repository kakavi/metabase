# What's H2?

H2 is the underlying application database thatâ€™s packaged with Kenga Analytics. H2 is a lightweight, in-memory database: perfect for getting spun up quickly, not so perfect for long-term usage. We recommend that you [migrate away from H2](../../operations-guide/start.html#migrating-from-using-the-h2-database-to-mysql-or-postgres) for production instances of Kenga Analytics.
